# Depth-Based Face Blurring with OpenCV

This project demonstrates depth-based face blurring in real-time using OpenCV and the Haarcascades face detection. The script captures video frames from either a video file or a webcam, detects faces, and applies depth-based blurring to faces in the background.

## How it Works ?

This Python script uses the OpenCV library to perform real-time face blurring based on depth estimation. Here's a brief explanation of how the script works:

Import Libraries:

cv2: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
Load Haarcascades Face Detector:

The script uses the Haarcascades face detection classifier provided by OpenCV. This pre-trained model is capable of detecting faces in images.
Specify Video Source:

The script can either read frames from a video file specified by the video_path variable or capture frames from a webcam using cv2.VideoCapture(0).
Capture Frames:

In a loop, the script continuously captures frames from the video source.
Face Detection:

Convert the captured frame to grayscale for better face detection accuracy.
Use the Haarcascades face detector to identify faces in the grayscale frame.
Depth-Based Face Blurring:

Sort the detected faces based on their size (larger faces first, as they might be closer).
Iterate through the sorted faces and compare the size and position of adjacent faces.
If the size condition (w1 * h1 > 3000) and position condition (y1 + h1 < y2) are satisfied, it is assumed that the current face is in the background compared to the next one.
Blur the face region using Gaussian blur (cv2.GaussianBlur) to simulate depth-based blurring.
Display the Result:

Show the resulting frame with the applied depth-based face blurring using cv2.imshow.
Exit the Loop:

The loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key, at which point the script releases the video capture object and closes the window.
This script simulates a depth-based face blurring effect by comparing the sizes and positions of adjacent faces. Keep in mind that this is a simplified approach and may not accurately represent real-world depth information. For precise depth estimation, specialized depth-sensing cameras or additional information would be required.
